## Machine Learning Tasks

### Classification Task
**Objective**: Predict health risk levels (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`) based on key health metrics.

**Dataset**:
- "Health Monitoring" dataset:
  - 3000 rows.
  - Features: `Heart_Rate`, `Blood_Pressure`, `Cholesterol`, `Blood_Sugar`.
  - Target variable: `Risk_Level`.
  - Includes missing values.

**Workflow**:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values using appropriate methods.
   - Normalize features for consistency.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Building**:
   - Choose and train a suitable classification algorithm.
   - Evaluate performance on the test set (accuracy as the key metric).
3. **Analysis**:
   - Visualize the class distribution.
   - Identify patterns and provide recommendations to improve results.

### Clustering Task
**Objective**: Cluster individuals based on daily commuting patterns to understand urban mobility behavior.

**Dataset**:
- "Urban Mobility Patterns" dataset:
  - 5000 entries.
  - Features: `Average_Speed`, `Waiting_Time`, `Daily_Commute_Distance`, `Traffic_Congestion_Score`.

**Workflow**:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values and normalize features.
   - Determine the optimal number of clusters using methods like the Elbow method or Silhouette score.
2. **Model Building**:
   - Apply a suitable clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN).
3. **Analysis**:
   - Visualize the clusters.
   - Derive insights about urban mobility challenges and recommend improvements.

### Deep Learning Regression Task
**Objective**: Predict property prices using a deep learning model.

**Dataset**:
- "House Price Prediction" dataset:
  - Features: `Size`, `Bedrooms`, `Bathrooms`, `Age`, `Proximity to City Center`.
  - Target variable: `Property Price`.

**Workflow**:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values and normalize the dataset.
   - Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
2. **Model Building**:
   - Design a deep learning regression model:
     - Architecture: Multiple layers, ReLU activation, and dropout for regularization.
     - Output layer: Single neuron with linear activation for price prediction.
   - Train and validate the model, then evaluate its performance (Mean Squared Error as the metric).
3. **Analysis**:
   - Visualize actual vs. predicted prices.
   - Derive insights from predictions to analyze model performance.

## Natural Language Processing Tasks

### Text Processing and Feature Representation
**Objective**: Prepare and process textual data, representing it using TF and TF-IDF schemes.

**Dataset**:
- Movie review dataset with columns:
  - `Tagline`: Promotional movie text.
  - `Overview`: Short movie description.

**Workflow**:
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load the dataset and explore columns.
   - Create a new column `Description` by concatenating `Tagline` and `Overview`.
2. **Text Processing**:
   - Convert text to lowercase.
   - Remove whitespace, stop words, special characters, and apply other preprocessing steps.
3. **Feature Representation**:
   - Generate TF and TF-IDF representations for each movie based on the `Description` column.

### Topic Modeling
**Objective**: Extract topics from movie reviews using TF and TF-IDF representations.

**Workflow**:
1. **Algorithm Selection**:
   - Select two algorithms for topic modeling (e.g., LDA, Truncated SVD, or Word2Vec).
2. **Implementation**:
   - Apply the algorithms to the TF and TF-IDF data.
3. **Analysis**:
   - Compare results and derive insights from the identified topics.

### Searching for Similar Movies
**Objective**: Recommend similar movies to a target title while excluding movies explicitly disliked by the user.

**Workflow**:
1. **Steps**:
   - Represent movies using textual data (e.g., TF-IDF vectors).
   - Compute similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity) between movies.
   - Exclude movies the user dislikes from the recommendations.
2. **Implementation**:
   - Rank movies based on similarity to the target movie.
   - Generate a list of recommended titles.
3. **Analysis**:
   - Visualize results to explore relationships between movies.
   - Provide insights into movie similarities and recommendation logic.
