Our project focuses on creating an interactive map that displays geographical data related to Norway's renewable energy sources—wind and water. The data was gathered from [geonorge.no](https://www.geonorge.no).

## Project Overview
- **Theme:** Renewable Energy Visualization  
- **Purpose:** To illustrate the distribution of wind farms, wind turbines, dams, and hydro-power plants across Norway.

## Features
- **Interactive Map:**  
  - Zoom to the user's location.  
  - Displays polygons (Wind Farms) and points (Wind Turbines, Dams, Hydro-power Plants).  
  - Clustering of point geometries, with clusters styled according to the number of points within them.  
  - Includes an overview map for additional context.  

- **Clickable Features:**  
  - Wind Farms: View detailed information like owner and production capacity.

## Collaboration
The team worked together via Discord meetings, using screen sharing to efficiently share ideas and provide support. We explored various datasets, selecting four unique ones for visualization:
- 1 Polygon: Wind Farms.
- 3 Points: Wind Turbines, Dams, Hydro-power Plants.

## Impact
This map provides an overview of Norway’s energy infrastructure and highlights the locations of its renewable energy sources. For wind farms, users can access specific data such as ownership and production capacity, offering valuable insights into the country's green energy landscape.
